# Lab Week 5: Expensive Digraph Paths

Compilation instructions:

Step 1: Go to the directory you wish to download and install the files

Step 2: run the following command: $git clone https://github.com/danieldunal/cse3150lab5.git

Step 3: You can use the command $g++ matrix_algo_implement.cpp ints_read_matrix.cpp ints_read_vector.cpp ints_write.cpp algorithm_function.cpp

to run main function. The output is sent to the graph_<number>_out text files.

You can also run $g++ unit_tests_algo_implmnt.cpp ints_read_matrix.cpp ints_read_vector.cpp ints_write.cpp algorithm_function.cpp

for basic unit testing.
